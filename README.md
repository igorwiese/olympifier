ML classification of 2012 London Olympians by sport.

The initial idea for this project came from David Epstein's *[The Sports Gene](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845114/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1591845114&linkCode=as2&tag=yostpori-20)* and an interview with the author on [Econtalk](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/09/david_epstein_o.html).

Data were obtained from [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/london-2012-olympics-data).
